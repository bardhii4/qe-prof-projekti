## Exercise 1

Write a program that calculates the value of **x!**, where **!** means factorial and **x** is a variable. Factorial is the result of multiplying all integers from one to the given number, e.g:

```JavaScript
5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
8! = 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8 = 40320
```


## Exercise 2

Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in the given range from **x** to **y**.

For example, for `x = 5`, `y = 10` the sum is `5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 45`.
