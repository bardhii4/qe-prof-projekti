## Exercise 1

Create a function that **will** ```return``` the sum of the numbers in an array. The array should be passed to the function as an argument.

Example:
```JavaScript
input -> [1,2,3]
output -> 6
```


## Exercise 2

Write an anonymous function which takes three numbers as arguments and **returns** the largest of them (returns rather than prints out on the screen). You can't print out until you return the result of the function.


## Exercise 3

Write a function `calculateTip(amount, rating)` which will take two arguments:
* amount to be paid,
* verbal description of service.
If the description is as defined below, the function should return the tip amount, if the description is unknown - the function should return "Unreadable description".

The description may take the following values:
* "Very good service" => 25% tip,
* "Good service" => 20% tip,
* "Average service" => 15% tip,
* "Bad service" => 0% tip.

Example:
```JavaScript
input -> 100, "Very good service"
output -> 25
```
